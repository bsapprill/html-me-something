                    That pigging flair of the nostrils?.. Mild tooth discoloration? (Naturally, I blame the sunlight)... And chin stubble slating me to be on track with such bearded legends as Abraham Lincoln???...<br /><br />

                    My name is Benjamin Apprill, (Ben, if you don't want to embody that grandmotherly tone at me), and this is my first official blog post!<br /><br />
                    
                    Upon being my first day taking selfies for profile pictures, (which is actually the truth, despite the underlying humorous tone at the beginning of the post), <b>I managed to learn a thing or two about the process:</b><br />
                </p>
            
                <ul class="ul1">

                                <b>NOT a good idea for the haircut!</b> Especially when I spent like, five minutes on it! (Do you know how long that is for styling in guy time???)

                            <li><p><b>Going out on a sunny day is definitely preferred.</b> 
                                      Using the sun to your advantage will add a pleasant glow to your skin... 
                                      Whereas the lack of sunlight will make your skin appear pale and morbid. 
                                      (Unless you are naturally tanned... like that asshole Channing Tatum!)

                            It allows including certain objects in the shot with you, or for getting whole body shots for things like your rock hard six pack which I, 
                            ahem... <i>conveniently</i> forgot to include in my shots... (just trust, just trust)...</p>

                        My name is Benjamin Apprill... And this is my first blog post.<br><br>
                        
                        With it being my first time taking an actual selfie, 
                        it was a natural vector to write my first blog post on the experience as well. 
                        Never again will I judge the selfie culture, 
                        never again will I belittle the subtle art of self-photography for the sake of highlighting attractive qualities...<br><br>
                        
                        It is a skill-set in its own right, 
                        a talent to be practiced. 
                        An activity to be properly tooled for, 
                        requiring a subtle sense for your setting... 
                        It is a creative expression that has taken the world by storm... 
                        And as I have found out today... for good reason.<br><br>
