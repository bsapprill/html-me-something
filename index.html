                    That pigging flair of the nostrils?.. Mild tooth discoloration? (Naturally, I blame the sunlight)... And chin stubble slating me to be on track with such bearded legends as Abraham Lincoln???...<br /><br />
                    
                    ...Channing Tatum better steer clear of the greater St. Louis area if he wants ANY chance of keeping his game up!!!<br /><br />

                    My name is Benjamin Apprill, (Ben, if you don't want to embody that grandmotherly tone at me), and this is my first official blog post!<br /><br />
                    
                    Upon being my first day taking selfies for profile pictures, (which is actually the truth, despite the underlying humorous tone at the beginning of the post), <b>I managed to learn a thing or two about the process:</b><br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3><b>The Weather</b></h3>
                        <ul>                            
                            <li><p>SUPER important! I dared to go out on a different day in the rain for the selfies... 
                                <b>NOT a good idea for the haircut!</b> Especially when I spent like, five minutes on it! (Do you know how long that is for styling in guy time???)
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><b>Going out on a sunny day is definitely preferred.</b> 
                                      Using the sun to your advantage will add a pleasant glow to your skin... 
                                      Whereas the lack of sunlight will make your skin appear pale and morbid. 
                                      (Unless you are naturally tanned... like that asshole Channing Tatum!)
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Ahem! I mean... <i>I'm</i> <b>not</b> intimidated by Channing's charm and good looks!...
                    (Eyes sliding shut in subconscious denial)...
                </p>
                
                <h3><b>MOVING ON! MOVING ON!...</b></h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><h3><b>Camera Angles</b></h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>This is where having friends...(NOT EVEN GOING THERE!), or some kind of delayed camera shot from a tri-pod, 
                            <b>will afford one much more creative angles to use to their advantage.</b> 
                            It allows including certain objects in the shot with you, or for getting whole body shots for things like your rock hard six pack which I, 
                            ahem... <i>conveniently</i> forgot to include in my shots... (just trust, just trust)...</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3><b>Uh... Did I say "With all facetiousness aside?"...</b></h3>

                    <li><h3><b>Multiple Takes</b></h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yeah, just an FYI?... IT'S CALLED SELFIE'S FOR A REASON!</li>
                        <li><p>When someone posts they just took a "selfie"... 
                            <b>ITS TOTAL BULLSHIT! NO ONE LOOKS THAT GOOD ON THE FIRST TAKES!...</b> 
                            (And I tried so hard D; ...) 
                            Alas, perhaps with practice, one can learn the magic of not uselessly filling their phone memory with horrendous attempts at looking excellent...</p>

                <p>Until that point?... 
                    You'll be spamming that shit like you're a contender on "America's Next Top Model"... 
                    lets hope you're not self-conscious if you have neighbors in viewing distance ;P

                        My name is Benjamin Apprill... And this is my first blog post.<br><br>
                        
                        With it being my first time taking an actual selfie, 
                        it was a natural vector to write my first blog post on the experience as well. 
                        Never again will I judge the selfie culture, 
                        never again will I belittle the subtle art of self-photography for the sake of highlighting attractive qualities...<br><br>
                        
                        It is a skill-set in its own right, 
                        a talent to be practiced. 
                        An activity to be properly tooled for, 
                        requiring a subtle sense for your setting... 
                        It is a creative expression that has taken the world by storm... 
                        And as I have found out today... for good reason.<br><br>
